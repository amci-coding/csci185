<p>During the last part of the course, you will be designing and implementing a short project of your choosing. Think of this project as one step towards a larger goal you might work towards – dedicated to a web-related topic or idea that you’re excited about. You don’t have to complete your whole vision…just a slice of it. The most important thing is for you to pick something you’re interested in and excited about.</p>

<p>Don’t be afraid to take a risk and explore something you do not yet know how to do – part of the fun of a final project is exploring new technologies and ideas.</p>

<h2 id="scoping-criteria--ground-rules">Scoping Criteria / Ground Rules</h2>
<p>Aim to scope your project so that you can arrive at a coherent stopping point by the end of the semester. I am hesitant to provide too many scoping criteria / restrictions a priori. I would rather work with you to scope something that is doable after first seeing what you’re interested in. That said, here are a few guidelines:</p>

<ul>
  <li>You may work on your own or in groups of 2-3. Your work plan should be commensurate with the number of people in your group.</li>
  <li>You will complete (1) a project proposal, (2) an mid-point project deliverable and presentation, and (3) a final project deliverable. Given this, think about how you might break up your work into two pieces: one that you complete by mid-April, and one that you complete by the end of the semester.</li>
  <li>Both of your deliverables should represent about 4-6 hours of effort (per teammate).</li>
  <li>You’re welcome to connect this to a larger project you’re working on outside of this class. That said, the work you submit for this class should be original work that extends the work that you are doing elsewhere (versus “double-dipping”).</li>
  <li>You are welcome to explore something that wasn’t directly covered in class. That said, at least 50% of your project should connect with the technologies and ideas from the class.</li>
  <li>This project is not your life’s work – it’s the beginning of a longer journey into web technologies. As such, scope your project to something reasonable. You can always build on these ideas later.</li>
</ul>
