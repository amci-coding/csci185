<h2 id="what-to-turn-in">What to turn in</h2>
<p>For your final deliverable, please write a reflection / self assessment (1-2 pages) that includes the following:</p>
<ol>
  <li>A link to your code repository</li>
  <li>A link to your live website</li>
  <li>A summary of your project and your process of making the website (feel free to draw from earlier text that you wrote). Please be sure to describe:
    <ul>
      <li>The overall goal of your project and intended audience.</li>
      <li>The web technologies / libraries / techniques you used.</li>
      <li>1-2 things you learned in the process of completing your project.</li>
      <li>How you believe you should be evaluated (list your accomplishments and how they relate to the themes of the class). Bullets fine.</li>
      <li>How you think you did on this project given the evaluation criteria you selected.</li>
      <li>What your next steps would be if you had more time.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ol>

<h2 id="rubric">Rubric</h2>

<p>In evaluating your final project, I will take the following into account (note that different criteria apply differently, depending on the direction of your project):</p>

<ul>
  <li>The time/effort you put into your project, and your intellectual curiosity</li>
  <li>Your reflection of your own learning and possible next steps</li>
  <li>Your instantiation of the design &amp; coding principles</li>
  <li>The coding and design elements that you used to bring your idea to life</li>
</ul>
