                For your final deliverable, you will be submitting your
                final project and a project write-up:
            </p>

            <h3 id="1-final-project-20-points">
                1. Final Project (20 Points)
            </h3>
            <p>
                To submit your final project, create a link from your
                homepage to your final project (like we have been doing all
                semester).
            </p>

            <h3 id="2-project-write-up-10-points">
                2. Project Write-Up (10 Points)
            </h3>
            <p>
                Write a reflection / self assessment (1-2 pages) that
                includes the following:
            </p>
            <ol>
                <li>A link to your code repository (GitHub)</li>
                <li>A link to your live website (GitHub Pages)</li>
                <li>
                    A summary of your project and your process of making the
                    website (feel free to draw from earlier text that you
                    wrote). Please be sure to describe:
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            The overall goal of your project and intended
                            audience.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            The web technologies / libraries / techniques
                            you used.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            1-2 things you learned in the process of
                            completing your project.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            How you believe you should be evaluated (list
                            your accomplishments and how they relate to the
                            themes of the class). Bullets fine.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            How you think you did on this project given the
                            evaluation criteria you selected.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            What your next steps would be if you had more
                            time.

            <p>
                In evaluating your final project, I will take the following
                into account (note that different criteria apply
                differently, depending on the direction of your project):
            </p>

            <ul>
                <li>
                    The time/effort you put into your project, and your
                    intellectual curiosity
                </li>
                <li>
                    Your reflection of your own learning and possible next
                    steps
                </li>
                <li>
                    Your instantiation of the design &amp; coding principles
                </li>
                <li>
                    The coding and design elements that you used to bring
                    your idea to life
                </li>
            </ul>

                                    experience?

                                    know how to do)?
