            <p>
                Your submission for this week’s deliverable should consist
                of three parts:
            </p>

            <ol>
                <li>
                    [6pts] <a href="#code">Sharing some design / code</a> of
                    what you have accomplished (Q1).
                </li>
                <li>
                    [4pts] Answering the
                    <a href="#reflection">4 reflective questions below</a>
                    (Q2-Q5).
                </li>
                <li>
                    [5pts] Sharing
                    <a href="#accomplishments">what you have accomplished</a>
                    with your classmates (you are welcome to use slides, but
                    you don’t have to).
                </li>
            </ol>

            <p>
                This is an opportunity for you to reflect on your
                accomplishments, and consider how you can best use the
                remaining time that you have to come to a reasonable
                stopping point for your project.
            </p>

            <h2 id="code">1. Code &amp; Designs [6pts]</h2>
            <p>
                Please share something that best represents your progress
                thus far. This could be a link to your your GitHub
                repository, a screenshot of your code (or some attachments),
                drawings of your screens, a mockup, etc. The code / designs
                you share should reflect 4-6 hours of work.
            </p>

                    We’re all still learning how all of these technologies
                    work, so no need to feel hesitant to share your
                    progress…even if you hoped to be further along! The
                    point is to put in a good faith effort and to get some
                    feedback.
                </p>

                there any specific feedback that you would like from Sarah?

                Given your experience this week, are you on track to deliver
                on what you proposed last week? If not, what adjustments to
                the scope of your project are you planning to make?

            <p>
                One of the great things about being in a class with other
                people who are also learning web technologies is that you
                can learn with one another. Given this, you will be sharing
                your ideas and your progress so far with some of your
                classmates during class on Wednesday, 4/19. This is a very
                low-pressure check-in, and is intended for you each to help
                each other explore different ideas and approaches and get
                some feedback and encouragement from your peers.
            </p>

            <h2 id="what-to-turn-in">What to Turn In</h2>
            <p>
                Please upload a file (either a text document or a zip file)
                that includes:
            </p>

            <ol>
                <li>
                    [6pts] Your code and/or design progress. Please share /
                    upload something that represents your progress. This
                    will probably include links to your repo / website, but
                    it could also include drawings, etc.
                </li>
                <li>[4pts] Your answers to the reflective questions.</li>
            </ol>

            <p>
                Note that your “Sharing your accomplishments” grade will be
                based on your participation in class on
                <strong>Wednesday, 4/19</strong>.
