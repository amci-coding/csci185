          About Web Design &amp; Development
        </h3>
        <p>
          Websites are living documents that require multiple forms of expertise
          to design and build. Some of the most important considerations fall
          outside of what is typically considered computer science, such as
          understanding the needs of the users and organizations and the
          potential implications of design decisions; or crafting clean,
          engaging visual designs. Other, equally important considerations are
          much more technical – writing code with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript,
          thinking about how information travels over the Internet, and learning
          new frameworks, architectural styles, and design patterns. Moreover,
          as web techniques/technologies continue to evolve, it is also import
          to “learn how to learn” about new technologies, including interpreting
          technical documentation, modifying and adapting sample code, and
          thinking about whether or not to use an external library (versus
          building something from scratch). Developing these competencies
          involves cultivating a variety of practices and dispositions (versus
          acquiring some fixed body of knowledge).
        </p>

        <p>
          Taking this course means committing – for 16 weeks – to practicing
          your emergent coding skills, experimenting with how you want to convey
          information to make it engaging and digestable, turning in weekly
          assignments, committing to doing homework, being present in class for
          individual and group activities, and most importantly, persevering
          when things get confusing / difficult and asking questions. Your
          enjoyment and success in this course depends on your commitment to
          showing up, engaging, and practicing your developing skills and ideas.
        </p>

        <h2 id="course-format">Course Format</h2>
        <p>
          The course includes a mix of lectures, in-class activities, tutorials,
          quizzes, homework, and projects. It is your responsibility to keep
          up-to-date on class material and announcements, as the schedule is
          subject to change. This includes material presented and announcements
          made in class, via email, or on Moodle.
        </p>

        <h3 id="class-participation-and-in-class-exercises-15">
          Class Participation and In-Class Exercises (15%)
        </h3>
        <p>
          We will use our scheduled class time to go over web design and
          development concepts, do practice problems together and make sure your
          questions get answered. Class meetings will be in person.
          Organizationally, most topics will span about a week (see the
          <a href="../index.html">course schedule</a>). Most class sessions have
          accompanying readings.
        </p>

        <ul>
          <li>
            I will take attendance during every class session. You may miss
            three class sessions – no questions asked – without a grade penalty.
            Any additional absences (beyond the three “freebies”) will impact
            your participation grade (and more to the point, your capacity to
            productively engage with the class).
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h3 id="tutorials-15">Tutorials (15%)</h3>
        <p>
          Most Fridays, we will complete a coding / design “tutorial.” Tutorials
          are intended to help you:
        </p>
        <ol>
          <li>
            Become familiar with the types of strategies you might use to
            approach problems (which will be closely related to the homework /
            projects).
          </li>
          <li>
            Get comfortable writing lots of programs (practice makes perfect!)
          </li>
          <li>
            Assess what you know and don’t know, so that you can make a plan to
            review various ideas and/or attend office hours.
          </li>
        </ol>

        <h3 id="homework--projects-50">Homework &amp; Projects (50%)</h3>
        <p>
          You will be given regular homework assignments that are intended to
          give you additional practice with the course ideas beyond the
          tutorials. They are each designed to take between 4-6 hours to
          complete, so leave yourself enough time!
        </p>

        <h3 id="quizzes-10">Quizzes (10%)</h3>
        <p>
          There will be 2 quizzes, which are intended to ensure that you
          understand the web design and programming and concepts relevant to the
          course. Your final exam score can replace one of your quiz scores if
          you did poorly on a quiz.
        </p>

        <h3 id="final-exam-10">Final Exam (10%)</h3>
        <p>
          There will be a cumulative final exam that will be administered during
          your regularly scheduled final exam slot.

          <li>
            You will complete all assignments on time and with interest,

          <li>
            You will bring your unique expertise, perspectives, and experiences

          As this is a programming course, you will be using the free software
          programs listed below. This software will take about 3GB of space to
          install. Installing and configuring programming software can be a
          hassle, but it is part of the process of developing your working

        <h2 id="grading">Grading</h2>
        <p>
          Your course grade is calculated based on homework and projects,

            </tr>
          </tbody>
        </table>

        <p>
          Final grades are assigned on a fixed scale: 93-100 is an A, 90-92.99
          is an A-, 87-89.99 is a B+, etc. Some other logistics:
        </p>

        <ol>
          <li>Final course grades will not be rounded or curved.</li>
          <li>
            There will not be a final exam, but final exam time will be used for
            the quiz.

            <li>You can drop your lowest tutorial score.</li>
            <li>
              You may miss <strong>three</strong> class sessions without your

          <p>
            Use this leniency wisely. I will not grant additional exceptions
            unless the circumstances are exceptional, and this will need to be

        <h3 id="homework--project-grading">Homework &amp; Project Grading</h3>
        <p>
          Homework will be due approximately every other week at 11:59pm on the
          specified date. Homework will be graded according to a published
          rubric that will be given when the assignment is released.
        </p>

        <h4 id="late-policy">Late Policy</h4>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Homework and project assignments must be submitted before the due
            time. Late work will be accepted within 30 days of the due
            date/time, with a 20% late penalty. No homework will be accepted if
            it is submitted after 30 days have passed.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h4 id="resubmission-policy">Resubmission Policy</h4>
        <p>
          If you did not successfully complete the objectives of the homework /
          project, you may correct your errors and resubmit. However, your grade
          will be penalized 10% with each subsequent attempt. Some example
          scenarios:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Scenario 1:</strong> I earn 60% on my homework assignment
            and decide to resubmit. I earn a 90% on my second attempt. My final
            HW score is an 80%.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Scenario 2:</strong> I earn an 80% on HW1 but turn it in
            late (so 20% late penalty applied = 60%). I decide to resubmit and
            earn an 100% on my second attempt. But, 20% penalty + 10% resubmit
            penalty applied, so I earn a 70%.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h3 id="tutorial-grading">Tutorial Grading</h3>
        <p>
          Tutorials will be graded according to the following scale (from 0-3
          points):

        <table>
          <tbody>
            <tr>

                correctly.
              </td>

          </tbody>
        </table>

        <p>
          Tutorials are due by 11:59PM on Friday (but I recommend that you just
          submit them at the end of class). I
          <strong>do not accept late tutorials</strong> because I post the
          solutions right away.
        </p>

        <h3 id="quizzes--final-exam">Quizzes &amp; Final Exam</h3>
        <p>
          There will be 2 quizzes and one final exam over the course of the

            <strong>Masking.</strong> Currently, there is no masking mandate at

            shuttles. Please respect individuals’ personal decisions to either
            wear or not wear a mask in any given circumstance.
            <ul>
              <li>
                <strong><em>Note:</em></strong> I may require masks in my
                office. I may also request that students voluntarily continue
                wearing masks in class, with the understanding that masking
                cannot be required.
              </li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Social distancing.</strong> There is no official policy
            regarding social distancing in the classroom. Please be sensitive to
            the fact that everyone’s comfort level will vary. Whenever possible,
            please keep several feet between yourself and a classmate. If a
            classmate requests more space, please do so kindly and without
            judgment or question.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Illness policy.</strong> Please stay home if you are ill,
            and email me – I will let you know how you can catch up /
            participate remotely.

        <h3 id="academic-honesty">Academic Honesty</h3>
        <p>
          In the past, there have been a few unfortunate instances in which
          students have presented work other than their own. Here are some
          guidelines to help you understand what is and is not appropriate”
        </p>

        <h4 id="tutorials">Tutorials</h4>
        <p>
          Helping other students with their in-class tutorial code is allowed
          and encouraged, but each student should type their own solution unless
          otherwise specified in the Tutorial instructions.
        </p>

        <h4 id="homework-and-project-work">Homework and Project Work</h4>
        <p>
          You are allowed and encouraged to discuss general approaches to
          solving problems, but all work you submit must be your own. Working
          “together” and presenting variants of the same file is not acceptable.
          Here are some specific guidelines to make sure you don’t cross the
          line:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Do not exchange programs or program fragments in any form – on
            paper, via e-mail, or by other means.
          </li>
          <li>
            While working with other students, it is perfectly acceptable to
            ‘look’ at each other’s code (perhaps while helping someone to
            debug), but you should NEVER be scribing (typing or writing) your
            own work while looking at someone else’s (on a computer screen,
            paper, whiteboard, etc.).
          </li>
          <li>
            Uploading materials from this course to websites that sell such
            content to students is prohibited by UNCA’s academic integrity
            policies, and may also put you at risk for violating copyright
            policies in UNCA’s Student Conduct Code.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <p>
          Contact Sarah Van Wart if you have any questions about what is
          appropriate.

          Using the Broader Web for Code and Ideas
        </h4>
        <p>
          In this class, I encourage you to explore the broader web for
          tutorials, code samples, new coding techniques, libraries, etc. After
          all, learning how to build websites is all about studying existing
          websites and how the work! That said, you must
          <em>acknowledge all sources contributing to your work.</em> If you
          receive any assistance from any source (Internet, peer, social media,
          etc.), please describe your source and that source’s contribution(s).
          If you have any questions about this, please don’t hesitate to contact
          me.
        </p>

        <p>
          Students violating the academic honesty policy on a test or exam will
          receive a grade of “F” in the course. Students violating the academic
          honesty policy on an assignment other than a test or exam will receive
          a grade of 0 on that assignment for the first offense, and will
          receive a grade of “F” in the course for the second offense. This will
          apply to all students involved in the violation, including both the
          source student and the copying student. It is your responsibility to
          ensure that your work is not used by other students.
        </p>

        <p>
          All cases of academic dishonesty will be reported to the Assistant
          Provost.

        <p>
          If a class meeting is canceled or due dates are moved due to inclement

          and a critical component of our dynamic community. Students with
          disabilities or temporary injuries/conditions may require
          accommodations due to barriers in the structure of facilities, course
          design, technology used for curricular purposes, or other campus
          resources. Students who experience a barrier to full access to this
          class should let the professor know, and/or make an appointment to
          meet with the Office of Academic Accessibility as soon as possible. To
          make an appointment, call 828.232.5050; email academicaccess@unca.edu;
          visit <a href="https://oaa.unca.edu/">https://oaa.unca.edu/</a> and
          click on “Schedule an Appointment”; or drop by the Academic
          Accessibility Office, room 008 in the One Stop suite (lower level of
          Ramsey Library). Learn more about the process of registering, and the
          services available through the Office of Academic Accessibility here:

        </p>

        <p>
          While students may disclose disability at any point in the semester,
          students who receive Letters of Accommodation are strongly encouraged
          to request, obtain and present these to their professors as early in
          the semester as possible so that accommodations can be made in a
          timely manner. It is the student’s responsibility to follow this
          process each semester.

          As a faculty member, I am a “responsible employee” and private
          resource. This means that if you share any information or discuss an
          incident with me regarding sexual or gender-based harassment, I must
          disclose this information to the Title IX Coordinator. Our goal is to
          ensure you are aware of the range of options available to you and have
          access to the resources you may need.

        <h3 id="academic-indicators">Academic Indicators</h3>
        <p>
          Faculty at UNC Asheville are required to use the university’s Academic
          Indicators system. The purpose of this system is to communicate with
          students about their progress in courses. Academic Indicators can
          reflect that a student’s performance is satisfactory at the time it is
          submitted, or they can indicate concerns (e.g., academic difficulty,
          attendance problems, or other concerns). Professors use this system
          because they are invested in student success and want to encourage
          open conversations about how students can improve their performance.
          When a faculty member submits an indicator that expresses a concern,
          the student receives an email from Academic Advising notifying them of
          the indicator and subsequent registration hold on their account. To
          clear the hold, the student must complete an online Response Form
          included in the alert e-mail.
        </p>

        <p>
          The student’s responses will be shared with the instructor and
          advising staff. If a student receives three or more indicators that
          show problems, they will need to meet with an advisor by scheduling an
          appointment using the online appointment service at
          <a href="https://advising.unca.edu/">advising.unca.edu</a> and select
          ‘Academic Alert Appointment’ as the type of appointment. The professor
          may also request to meet with the student to discuss the indicator. It
          is in the student’s best interest to complete the process quickly, as
          students who do so are more likely to earn credit for the course.
          Failure to complete the process means the student won’t be able to
          register for the next semester’s classes until they have submitted the
          required form and completed any requested meeting requirements.
          Questions about the indicator system can be directed to Anne Marie
          Roberts (amrober1@unca.edu) in the
          <a href="https://www.unca.edu/academics/academic-success/"

        <h3 id="mental-health-support">Mental Health Support</h3>
        <p>
          As a student, you may experience a range of challenges that can
          interfere with learning, such as stressful life events, experiences of
          anxiety and/or depression, self-harm, substance use, and/or unusual
          difficulty with ordinary life activities. The increased stress of
          school can also make existing mental health struggles more difficult
          to manage. Support is available and treatment can help. Learn more
          about the confidential mental health services UNC Asheville provides
          to support student success at
